## current problems with protests
* ðŸ‘€ Lack of Privacy
* Traditional protests and activism involve public gatherings and visible participation
* Current online protest/petition platforms like change.org often lack sufficient privacy and security measures, you can be easily traced

* ðŸ”‘ Data Integrity and Manipulation:
* Protests rely on accurate representation of participant numbers and support levels.
* Current systems are susceptible to data manipulation and tampering, undermining the credibility and impact of protest movements.

In order to address the challenges of privacy, data integrity, and user security in all sorts of protests and petitions, 
a robust and secure solution is imperative.  We need a privacy-preserving focused solution

# Introducing ZkProtest

* ZkProtest is a privacy-focused decentralized zkApp built using 
SnarkyJS, zero knowledge proofs, and deployed on the Mina blockchain.
* It aims to enable anonymous and secure protests where 
participants can join and support various causes while preserving their privacy.
* As a result, ZkProtest allowing users to join and support causes 
without compromising their personal information.
* Privacy preserving, accountable, untraceable

## technical implementation (see video for more details)
### technologies used 
* SnarkyJS
* zk-SNARKs
* Cryptographic hash function
* Merkle Tree

## impact ðŸ’¥
* allows people to engage in protests without compromising their identities, offering a safe space for expression.
* beneficial in areas where freedom of speech is limited, permitting participants to support causes without the risk of punishment.
* ZkProtest's privacy-preserving nature is likely to attract a diverse audience, especially those who value their privacy and desire to effect change.

## things to consider in the future ðŸ¤”
* Build a beautiful frontend UI for users to interact with ZkProtest instead of using the command line
* Create the ability for users to create their own protests (improved workflow)
* Improve busniuess model, MINA donations to protests, etc
